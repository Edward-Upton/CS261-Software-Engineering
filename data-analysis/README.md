## Setup

1. Run `pipenv shell` to go into the python virtual environment.
2. Run `pipenv install` to install all dependencies.
3. You may need to run `python3 -m textblob.download_corpora` if it is the first time you have used this code.
4. Now use `python3 <filename>` to run python files and it will use the virtual environment version.
5. To leave the environment run `exit`.

**To install packages, ensure you are in the environment by using `pipenv shell` and use `pipenv install <packageName>` to install any packages and these will be added to the environment data automatically.**

<!-- For RAKE
pip install rake-nltk

(If you would rather use github)
git clone https://github.com/csurfer/rake-nltk.git
python rake-nltk/setup.py install

(If you get stopwords error)
python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('stopwords')"


For TextBlob
pip install -U textblob
python -m textblob.download_corpora

(If you would rather use github)
git clone https://github.com/sloria/TextBlob.git -->

## Functionality

### runningAvg

This function takes in the current average, the number of elements considered in said 
average, and a new element to add to the average. It then calculates the new average 
including this value and returns it. It is used to provide the running average 
functionality to the application.

    Parameters:
    value (int): The value to be added to the new average
    runningAvg (float): The running average of existing entries in the database
    entryCount (int): The number of entries that already exist in the database

    Returns:
    float:New average value to replace the old average

### textSentiment

This function take a string of text as input, and retrieves the sentiment of the text 
using a textblob instance.

    Parameters:
    text (String): The text for which the sentiment will be analysed.

    Returns:
    float: Sentiment of the text

### textAdjectives

This function extracts all of the adjectives from the passed text using a textblob instance. 
As well as a key indicating statement sentiment.

    Parameters:
    text (String): The text for which the adjectives will be extracted.

    Returns:
    list: List of adjectives.
    int: Key indicating statement polarity.

### textKeyPhrases

This function extracts all of the important phrases from the passed text, uses the 
rake-ntlk package to do so.

    Parameters:
    text (String): The text for which the key phrases will be extracted.

    Returns:
    list: List of important phrases

### timeSeries

This function calculates and modifies the average of an interval in the time series data
with a new value submitted by the user. This can be used for all fields that have some
sort of average as a number.

    Parameters:
    value (Float): The value to add to the element.
    timeSeriesData (dict): Dictionary of the average value for each interval with the number of entires.
    interval (Float): Length of interval in seconds.
    start_time (Javascript Time): Start time of the event.

    Returns:
    dict: Modified time series data.

### getIntervalTime

This function calculates the interval a certain time should be in using the length of the
intervals and the start time. This is returned as the start time of this interval.

    Parameters:
    start_time (Time): The start time of the event.
    current_time (Time): The current time.
    interval (Float): The length of the interval in seconds.
