# CS261-Software-Engineering

CS261: Software Engineering Group Project

[Project Guide](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/teaching/material/cs261/project)

## Client - [files](./client)

The progressive web app using React.

## Server - [files](./server)

The Flask REST API and data analysis.

## Using this Repository

Here are instructions on how to download, run and edit the code.

1. First I advise to download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) to help managing the repository.
2. Open GitHub Desktop, click `Add` and go to `Clone Repository...`.
3. Click on `URL` and paste in to the URL field `https://github.com/engiego/CS261-Software-Engineering` (This is the address of where the project is stored on GitHub).
4. Choose where you want it to be stored locally on your computer then click `Clone`.
5. On the main page of GitHub Desktop, click on `Current Branch` which should say `main` currently.
6. You want to change this branch to the section of the project you are working on (`client` or `server`). Branch `main` should only be used when merging the two sections together and testing of the whole system.

**AVOID EDITING THE MAIN BRANCH SINCE THIS WILL MAKE COMBINING CHANGES DIFFERENT PEOPLE HAVE DIFFICULT**

7. When you want to commit your code changes, go onto GitHub Desktop, select this repository and write a commit message.
8. Then click commit and `Publish` them to GitHub

### A few things to note

- Before editing code, make sure you `Fetch` the latest code by going onto GitHub Desktop and clicking `Fetch origin`.
- When changes are needed accross different branches, we will merge the `client` and `server` into the `main` branch which will update them.
- We can go through it all in our next meeting (Wednesday 20th Jan).
